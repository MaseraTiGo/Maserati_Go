#some trubles I met during doing this fuck simple web
No.1
    the path, It's really almost drived me creazy!
    finally, I found ,I just needed to set the MEDIA_URL'value as my project name,that't the root ,all will be ok, suck as the flow things:
    urls.py
    urlpatterns += static('/upload/', document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

    settings.py
    MEDIA_URL = '/AsTon/'  
    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'martin/media')

No.2    
    missing position argument 'on_delete',just need add 'on_delete=models.CASCADE'
